# 🔥 Sharingan Designer - Become an Uchiha! 👁️

## 🎯 What the heck is this?

Ever wanted to design your own Mangekyo Sharingan like Itachi, Sasuke, or Madara? Well, now you can!

Sharingan Designer is a web-based application that lets you create custom kaleidoscope-style eye patterns inspired by the Naruto anime. 🔥

## ✨ Features

- **🎨 Bezier Curve Editor**: Create complex patterns with smooth curves (smoother than Kakashi's Chidori!)
- **🔄 Symmetry Tools**: 3-axis, 4-axis, or more! Make your Sharingan perfectly balanced (unlike Naruto's Rasen Shuriken)
- **🎭 Character Presets**: Start with Itachi or Shisui designs, then go wild with your own creativity
- **💾 Save & Load**: Never lose your masterpiece (unlike Obito lost his eye... twice)
- **🎬 Animation**: Watch your Sharingan spin hypnotically

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Choose a Preset**: Start with Itachi or Shisui, or go rogue with a blank canvas
2. **Draw Your Pattern**: Use the bezier editor to create your design
3. **Set Symmetry**: Choose how many axes for your kaleidoscope effect
4. **Customize Colors**: Pick your pupil and path colors
5. **Animate**: Watch your creation come to life
6. **Save**: Export your masterpiece as PNG or save the configuration
